# Red-Flag-Detection-using-YOLOv8
Red-Flag-Detection-using-YOLOv8 is an approach that utilizes the YOLOv8 (You Only Look Once version 8) deep learning model to detect red flags or warning signals within an image or video feed. Here's a detailed description of how this could be implemented:

Dataset Preparation: First, gather and prepare a dataset of images containing red flags or warning signs. This dataset should include a variety of images with different backgrounds, lighting conditions, and orientations of the flags.
YOLOv8 Model: YOLOv8 is a state-of-the-art object detection model that can be used for real-time detection tasks. It's an evolution of the YOLO (You Only Look Once) architecture, which is known for its efficiency and accuracy.
Training the Model: Train the YOLOv8 model using the prepared dataset. This involves configuring the model architecture, setting hyperparameters, and feeding the dataset into the model for training. The goal is to teach the model to accurately identify and localize red flags in images.
Data Augmentation: To enhance the model's robustness, apply data augmentation techniques such as rotation, scaling, flipping, and color jittering to artificially increase the diversity of training data.
Integration and Deployment: Once trained, integrate the YOLOv8 model into your application or system for real-time red flag detection. This could involve deploying the model on edge devices for efficient inference.
